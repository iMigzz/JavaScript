So before you start explaining something to the computer, in other words, writing a program, you need to understand exactly what you want to achieve and how you want to achieve it. Secondly, the solution we propose and write in the form of a program must be 100% unambiguous – the computer cannot guess anything.

A simple example from a slightly different field: at some point in your life, you probably happened to buy a piece of furniture that required assembly. Assembling it is a problem that you, the buyer, have been burdened with. In order for you to cope with this task, you get a set of instructions to guide you through the whole process. You’re acting as an interpreter at this point, using a program that will allow you to complete the task. The success of your mission depends on the quality of these instructions, whether they are precise and unambiguous, and do not come from another piece of furniture. In the end, it may turn out that you have constructed not the furniture of your dreams, but a surrealistic construction from another dimension.

For the instructions to be good, someone who develops them must know exactly what they should illustrate, in what order certain actions should be carried out, at which stages something is easiest to confuse, and so on. And of course, they must know what effect is to be achieved at the end.
